# [:ocean: Laminar](https://github.com/dosyago/laminar)

**Laminar** is the on-prem, downloadable, no phone-home web RPA solution to automate any sequence of interactions in the Chrome browser.

## Completely Open Source

Developed completely in the ocean, using already open-source parts, Laminar is built to be robust, open, and transparent.

## Completely Free

I believe RPA should be available to everyone. The tools exist, it's not that complex, there's no need to pay by the month for what you can do on your own workstations. I see no reason to charge for this software. It's completely free. 

## Completely Comprehensive

Laminar aims to provide an intuitive interface to easily automate *anything* someone can do in a web browser. 

## Secure, Simple and Open

Because you're on your own machine, you can automate your own internal web-based/browser-based apps, without every leaving your intranet. 

Nothing you do, and no data about what you're automating, no credentials, no nothing, is ever sent from Laminar to any 3rd-party servers. 

Laminar does just what you tell it to do, how you tell it to do it, and as many times as you tell it do.
